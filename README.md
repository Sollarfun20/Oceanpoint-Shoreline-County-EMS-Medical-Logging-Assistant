## How to use
You can use the application through 2 methods:

1. Download the most recent source code (.py file with the highest number), download a python 3.9 interpreter, and run the code.


2. Download the most recent executable version in the Executable Versions folder and run the .exe file, keep in mind you will have to bypass windows defender/antivirus software as they flag it because it doesn't have an official developer signature (which costs $$$)
